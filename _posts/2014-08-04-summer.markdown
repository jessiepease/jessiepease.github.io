I am spending my time this summer in Cupertino, CA working at Apple as a Software Engineering Intern on the Privacy Engineering team. Aside from work, I enjoy hanging out with my roommate Cristina and other intern friends. I am not usually the YOLO type, but this summer I've been trying to do things outside of my comfort zone. I did the Gladiator Run, I joined a kickball team, I explored the night life of San Francisco and the Peninsula, and I've been making a ton of new friends.

I leave for Sweden in exactly 16 days. I couldn't be more excited, scared, and antsy. It's hard to concentrate on work when I want to day dream about the fall semester. 

I plan to start blogging at least a couple days a week one I get to Stockholm. 

I'll leave with you a few summer pics...
