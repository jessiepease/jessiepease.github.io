I took off on the morning of August 20 from Sacramento International Airport. Mom and Dad were sad of course, but I was ready for adventure! My first flight across the US had a lot of turbulence, but we landed safely in Washington DC. My next flight to Copenhagen was delayed by two hours. Keep ya posted!
