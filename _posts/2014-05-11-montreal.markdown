I went to Montreal, QC for Pycon in April of 2014. Flying across the country for a
weekend was obviously a challenge, but also an adventure. Through this trip, I learned
about the Canadian culture, recent political changes, and the culture that revolved
around speaking French. I had a wonderful experience at the Pycon Conference as well. The
talks I found most interesting were 
[The Sorry State of SSL](http://pyvideo.org/video/2651/the-sorry-state-of-ssl) and 
<a href="http://pyvideo.org/video/2570/the-young-coder-lets-learn-python">Young Coders</a>.

I also had the opportunity to spend time with my mentor, Julia Grace from Tindie.
She introduced me to a bunch of amazing Pythonistas. It was an amazing experience
to spend time with her across the country!
