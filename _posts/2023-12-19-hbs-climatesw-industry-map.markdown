### Embarking on a New Journey: A Decade Later


It's my first blog post in almost a decade, but here goes nothing! In the past year and a half, I've been heads down here at HBS, focusing on honing my technical leadership skills and pivoting my career towards climate tech. My journey as a software engineer and engineering manager has often led me to wonder where my skillset might best contribute in climate. Climate tech is rich with innovations in hardware engineering, physics, and materials science, but presents unique challenges and opportunities for someone with a software background.

### Mapping the Software Landscape in Climate Tech

I've put together an industry map highlighting key *software* companies in the climate tech space. These companies are diverse in their missions, ranging from supporting farmers to influencing consumer behavior. While not every climate challenge can be solved with software alone,  software plays a crucial role in our collective response to these issues.

### Learning from Industry Leaders: Climate Corporation and OPower

During fall semester, I had the chance to dive into case studies of two pioneering software-centric solutions in climate tech: Climate Corporation and OPower. These solutions stand out for their innovative use of data to drive behavioral change. Climate Corporation, for instance, combines public weather data with farmers' yield information to make insightful predictions and recommendations. OPower, on the other hand, leverages psychology and detailed customer energy usage data to promote energy-saving habits through engaging, personalized reports.

### Connecting and Collaborating!

As I continue down this exciting path, I am eager to connect with fellow innovators and thinkers who are also passionate about developing software-first solutions in climate tech. Whether you're working on a project similar to those mentioned above or pioneering your own unique venture, I'd love to hear from you!
