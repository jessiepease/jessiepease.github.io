### I am currently a software engineer at Apple working on Health Software. I graduated from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo a few years ago and moved up to the Bay Area for work.

### I like to travel, spend time with my puppy (Alice) and boyfriend (Erik), work out, and improve my Swedish language skills. This website mostly houses my travel blogs and more photos in the future.
