### I am currently an iOS Engineering Manager at Apple working on Health Software. I am an alum of Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo and KTH in Stockholm, Sweden.

### I like to travel, spend time with my puppy (Alice) and partner (Erik), work out, and improve my Swedish language skills. This website mostly houses my travel blogs and more photos in the future.
